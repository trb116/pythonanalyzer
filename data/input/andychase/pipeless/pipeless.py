    """ Pipeline
    Takes:

    - (Optional, Default: None) A function to run on errors that
      takes an errored_item and an exception as inputs.

      If a result other than None is returned, result
      continues in the pipeline. If None, pipeline
      exceptions are raised (useful for debugging).
      Example: error_function(errored_item, exception)

    - (Optional, Default: False) A True/False on whether you want the pipeline
      to be built using function builders or just the pipeline functions directly.

    Outputs:

    - function_annotator
      ^- Annotate your pipeline functions with this in order in which they should run.
      The pipeline functions should generate and return (a function that takes 1 item,
      and returns None, 1 item, or yields many items).
      `` def fn(): return lambda item: item + 1 ``

    - main_runner(item_generator)
      ^- Takes a generator or list of items and creates a generator out of them.
      Optional arguments ```functions_to_run``` and ```function_groups_to_skip```

    - functions_list
      ^- A list of tuples containing your functions as (group, name, function_builder).
      You can ignore this one if you like.
